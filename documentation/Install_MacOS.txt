Installing CRRCSim on MacOS
-----------------------

The installation on MacOS is based on libraries and build environment
provided via MacPorts. See: https://www.macports.org

If you have MacPorts installed, you can create a self contained bundle
and a dmg file for distribution.

Installing required libraries via MacPorts
-------------------------------

This assumes that you have MacPorts already installed on your Mac.

     sudo port install plib jpeg portaudio libsdl

If you build directly from the mercurial repository, then you have to
install the autotools also.

     sudo port install autoconf automake

If you want to build the MacOS Application bundle, you need

     sudo port install dylibbundler

Building and Install
----------------------------------

This will create an installation in a local directory. If you build directly from the mercurial repository, then
you have to run the autotools. Assume the following directory structure

~/mycrrcsim
   |---crrcsim (This is code repository)
   |---install   (The local installation directory containing the resources)
   |---build     (The out-of-tree build directory)

Then you can build and install with

    cd ~/mycrrcsim/crrcsim
    ./autogen.sh
    cd ../build
    ../crrcsim/configure --prefix=/Users/USER/mycrrc/install  LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include
    make
    make install
    ../install/bin/crrcsim

The LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS are required because the libraries installed via MacPorts are located there.

Build the MacOS Application Bundle
----------------------------

After the previous build and install steps, you can create a MacOS application bundle "crrcsim.app" in the build directory

    make macbundle

You can start the application with

    open crrcsim.app

The DMG file for distribution "crrsim.dmg" is created via

    make macdmg

The DMG creation step will remove the application bundle "crrcsim.app".
